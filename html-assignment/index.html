    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi,My name is Hui Chen, I'm from China. I love drawing, photography, and traveling, and I've had the chance to explore many places like Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. I enjoy experiencing different cultures and capturing beautiful moments through my travels.

        I worked as a UI designer in Shanghai for seven years, but I never had the chance to write code. I believe that a designer who can code is much more professional and versatile. That’s why I’m now working towards becoming a designer who excels in both design and coding skills.
