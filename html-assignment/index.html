        <h2>Hi everyone~~</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; width: 800px;">
            ðŸ˜Š My name is Hui Chen, I'm from China. I love drawing, photography, and traveling, and I've had the
            chance to explore many places like Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. I have a puppy named MeiMei, this
            photo was taken when I was traveling with her.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; width: 800px;">
            I worked as a <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> designer in Shanghai for seven years, but I never had
            the chance to write code. I believe that a designer who can code is much more professional and versatile. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m now working
            towards becoming a designer who excels in both design and coding skills.
